# Changelog

## 1.2.2

Fixed plugin failing to load against current openclaw versions due to
reliance on a private SDK subpath (`openclaw/plugin-sdk/mattermost`)
for `loadOutboundMediaFromUrl`. Internalized the helper in
`src/load-media.ts` to remove the dependency on non-public openclaw
internals.
